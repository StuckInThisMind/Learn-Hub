I mean, can any of you relate? If you can, let me know in the comments. Here are three ways to get people to pay attention to you.\\n\\nNumber one: slap them. That\\'s why you slap them. I\\'m just kidding, don\\'t slap them. You might hurt your hand. Just kidding. Here are the real three steps.\\n\\nNumber one: say their name. Someone\\'s name is the sweetest sound you could possibly make. This is what commands their attention. Number two: right after you\\'ve made the sweetest sound, saying their name, pause, and don\\'t talk until they give you their undivided attention. Number three: compliment them for a future desired behavior. Let me show you exactly what I mean by doing these three things together.\\n\\n\\\"Peter.\\\" Oh, yeah, hey, hey, man. Thanks for giving me your attention. There\\'s been something I\\'ve been meaning to talk to you about. Um, it\\'s actually a little bit difficult for me. Um, do you mind putting on some pants? It\\'s been negatively affecting the culture in our studio because, you know, Dan\\'s crying during lunch, and it\\'s negatively impacting his marriage. And, oh yeah, I\\'ll pee.\\n\\nAll jokes aside, this is actually a very powerful and effective technique to get people\\'s attention. Try it.
